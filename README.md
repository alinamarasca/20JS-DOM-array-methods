# DOM Array Methods: 
practice using ```forEach()```, ```map()```, ```filter()```, ```sort()```, ```reduce()``` side by side, with a sprincle of ```async/await```.
Names are generated using [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/), wealth - ```Math.random()``` method.

* Add User button fetches a user from API
* Double Money button uses ```map()```
* Show Only Millionaires uses ```filter```
* Sort By Richest uses ```sort()```(I added toggle: on first click it show richest first, on second - poorest first; no sorting applied by default)
* Calculate entire Wealth uses ```reduce()```
